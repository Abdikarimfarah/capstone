Its bright yellow iris-like flowers are 7-10 cm across, and it produces dry capsules containing pale brown seeds. This plant thrives in wet conditions, particularly wetlands, and can tolerate submersion, low pH, and anaerobic soils. It spreads rapidly through rhizomes and water-dispersed seeds, often growing alongside Typha in shallower water. It serves as an important habitat for the endangered corncrake. While primarily aquatic or marginal, its rhizomes can endure dry periods. Both the petals and stem of I. pseudacorus are toxic to animals and plants.',
